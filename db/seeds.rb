Destination.create(title: "Algarve", content: " The Algarve boasts a fantastic Mediterranean climate that has seen it become one of Europe's most popular holiday destinations. With an annual average of 3000 sunshine hours and over 300 days of sun a year, the Algarve is one of Europe's sunniest places, sunnier even than California in the USA. The summer months will see 12 hours of sunshine per day on average and almost no rain. With the Atlantic the west coast, resorts on the Algarve's east, nearer to the spanish border, such as Monte Gordo and Tavira are generally hotter and drier than those to the west such as Lagos and Praia da Luz. The difference is not enough to alter your travel plans unless travelling in search of heat in the shoulder seasons of autumn and spring.", price: 1000)

Destination.create(title: "Antalya", content: "Antalya is one of the most popular tourist holiday destinations in Turkey, located on the southern coast of the country in between the Taurus Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. The resort is situated on a clifftop overlooking the sea and due to its close proximity to the Taurus mountain range, it's protected from cold northerly winds, which help keep temperatures warm throughout the year.
Within Antalya you'll find some of the Mediterranean's cleanest beaches, making it the perfect holiday destination for travellers who love to relax and sunbathe. The resort also boasts palm-lined promenades, a historic castle and a stylish marina which have led to the region becoming well known as the Turkish Riviera. Antalya enjoys a typical Mediterranean climate, with just two major seasons instead of the usual four - long, hot and dry summers and much shorter, milder winters. Throughout the year, temperatures typically range between 5C and 34C. On average, there are 300 days of uninterrupted sunshine each year and very few days of rainfall - only 77 across the entire year. The winter sees the vast majority of the rainfall, with summer remaining mostly dry, with warm to high temperatures and loads of sunshine.", price: 1200)


Destination.create(title: "Corfu", content: "Corfu, the most northern of the Greek Islands, is the most popular of the Ionian Islands and experiences a climate which differs from many of its neighbouring islands. Corfu's climate is not quite the typical 'Summer Holiday' type of climate, but it is thoroughly enjoyable despite its differences from other beachside resort locations such as Tenerife and Mykonos. The appearance of the island reaps the benefits of its unusual weather and the result is a luscious, green landscape inclusive of three million olive trees! Corfu is a cosmopolitan island where you can party just as hard as you can relax, and the weather in the area is suitable for both. The region receives slightly more rain than other islands which contributes to the beautiful greenery which sits idyllically upon the crystal waters. In recent years the weather in Corfu has been somewhat unpredictable. The winter of 2002/03 saw the area shattered by heavy rains, causing a severe mudslide near Messonghi beach. Summers are generally milder in Corfu than the rest of Greece but the area has been experiencing sporadic heat waves in the recent few years.", price: 1500)

Destination.create(title: "Costa Blanca", content: "The Costa Blanca consists of 200 kilometres of coastline belonging to Alicante in the country of Spain. Its name means literally the 'White Coast' and it is home to a typical Mediterranean climate with long and hot summers and brief and quite mild winters. You can expect around 3000 hours of sunshine per year and an average afternoon temperature in excess of 20C for most of the year. The temperature is cooled in the summer by sea breezes and the surrounding mountains protect the resort from cold northerly winds in the winter. You can expect up to 325 of sunshine days per year. Summers are very long, hot and dry, while winters are cool to mild, with very scarce precipitation in the course of the whole year. Although there have been extreme weather conditions here, such as flooding and storms, the weather is generally extremely enjoyable the majority of the time. The topography is mountainous to the north and west, then mostly flat to the south. The white sandy beaches and clear blue waters make it a beautiful destination to holiday in - in summer, the weather is nothing less than spectacular; in winter, pleasant temperatures make a popular escape for people from western and northern Europe. If you're planning on spending your holiday in the Costa Blanca, you can check the detailed and up-to-date weather forecast before choosing your preferred holiday dates.", price: 1300)


Destination.create(title: "Costa Brava", content: "The Costa Brava enjoys a Mediterranean climate with long hot summers and short mild winters. Due to its north eastern location, Costa Brava's weather is generally cooler and wetter than many other coastal areas in Spain. Whilst this might sound like a negative point, the cooler damper weather is much enjoyed during summer, when many other parts of Spain are affected by scorching temperatures.
In land from the coast lie the Pyrenees Mountains which protect the coast by trapping wet weather coming over from the west, simultaneously sending the cool tramuntana winds down into the lowlands and coastal plain.
In addition to the Pyrenees Mountains, the weather in the Costa Brava is also affected by many conflicting weather systems coming over the Atlantic from Europe, Africa and the Mediterranean Sea and as such can be very unpredictable, with conditions regularly changing considerably between one year and the next.
The mountainous topography creates regional variation in weather conditions. Many bays have microclimates, depending on the direction they face. Generally, the areas of higher altitude experience cooler, wetter conditions throughout the year than the lower-lying areas.", price: 1400)

Destination.create(title: "Crete", content: "After a cold, wet winter, the weather begins to improve in Crete in spring. This season which is classed as April and May - starts off with a low average temperature of 17C which quickly jumps up to a much warmer 24C by the end of the season. At this time of year, average highs are 20C and 24C, respectively, whilst average lows are 10C 12C, respectively.

Destination.create(title: "Fuerteventura", content: "The weather in Fuerteventura is unlike any of the other Canary Islands. It sits in the Atlantic, 108 km from the northwest mainland African coast and the weather it experiences is quite unique. Fuerteventura and its neighbouring islands have been called 'the island of eternal spring' because of their pleasant weather throughout the year. There isn't an enormous amount of annual temperature variation. There is still a distinction between the 'summer' and 'winter' months, but the island very rarely experiences temperature extremes.
On the whole Fuerteventura is generally cooler in summer than nearby resorts, so you may find many people flocking to the island to escape from the harsh heat of the Spanish mainland. The winter sees the island warmer than Majorca and other Spanish resorts, and it is not uncommon for the beaches to still be filled with tourists sunbathing, even in the cooler winter months.", price: 1400)

Destination.create(title: "Gran Canaria", content: "Gran Canaria benefits from year round sunshine and warmth with little seasonal variation. Summers are dry and hot while winters are only a little cooler with few showers. The island, the third largest of Spain's Canary Islands, are often called 'Islands of Eternal Spring' due to their exceptional climate.May until November, is hot and sunny. The average high temperature stays in the mid to high twenties, reaching a peak of 28C in August. At the beginning of the season nights cool off  to around 17C but for the rest of the season it usually around 20C overnight. The northeast trade winds help to keep these high temperatures comfortable in coastal regions, but most would agree that the mid 20s provide an ideal level of heat.
The west side of the island can sometimes be affected by the sirocco, a hot, dry wind that originates in the Sahara. This can push temperatures into the 30s, bring a hazy sky and even clouds of dust and sand. When hot, dry conditions prevail for long, forest fires can ensue. In 2007 forest fires did extensive damage to Gran Canaria and Tenerife.", price: 1500)

Destination.create(title: "Lanzarote", content: "Lanzarote enjoys a subtropical climate with warm temperatures, low rainfall and endless sunshine throughout the year. It is the northernmost and - along with Fuerteventura - the easternmost island of Spain's Canary Islands. These islands sit far south of the Spanish mainland, closer to the west coast of Northern Africa than Spain itself, leading to higher temperatures and a drier climate than that which most Spanish resorts experience. The Canaries are often dubbed 'The Islands of Eternal Spring', due to their enviable climate, but temperatures do vary throughout the year - dropping slightly in winter and increasing a little in summer. Despite this, Lanzarote and the other Canaries are still thought to have the perfect temperature all-year-round, much cooler than the Sahara, which lies at the same latitude, but warmer and drier than the rest of Europe.", price: 1400)


Destination.create(title: "Larnaca", content: "Cyprus is a summer holiday destination favoured by sun-seekers the world over, with an abundance of sunshine and soaring temperatures during the typical summer months of July and August.

The city is one of Cyprus's major seaside resorts, famed for its picturesque seafront, lined with rows and rows of palm trees and scenic city promenades. It is often named as an area of outstanding natural beauty and there are numerous beautiful beaches within close range of the city.
Variations in temperature and rainfall throughout the island are determined by altitude and distance from the coast. Larnaca lies at one of the lowest altitude points in Cyprus and is situated on the coast, so as a result it enjoys gorgeous weather year round. Larnaca's climate is typically Mediterranean. This means it's characterised by long, dry summers and mild winters, which are separated by the short shoulder seasons of autumn and spring.", price: 1400)

Destination.create(title: "Majorca", content: "Majorca, also spelt Mallorca, enjoys a typical Mediterranean climate of hot, dry summers and mild winters. The island is mountainous and this gives rise to varying climatic conditions according to location: the prevailing winds come from the northwest so southeast regions are generally warmer and drier. Northwest regions and the mountains receive the highest levels of rain, though this is never particularly high.
Coastal regions receive around 300 days of sunshine per year. Higher altitudes always experience cooler temperatures. Majorca sits in the Mediterranean Sea, south of mainland Spain and north of Africa.", price: 1600)

Destination.create(title: "Rhodes", content: "Rhodes is the largest of the Greek Dodecanese Islands, located south-west of mainland Greece and north-east of Crete. This island is best known for its beautiful beaches, ancient ruins and historical remnants of when it was occupied by the Knights of Saint John, as well as its pleasantly warm weather, due to the island's southerly positioning within Europe.
The island, which is shaped like a spearhead, covers approximately 1400 km^2, with a staggering 220km of that space being coastline. The city of Rhodes - the island's capital - is located on the northern tip, as are the island's ancient and modern harbours. Away from the city of Rhodes, the island is comprised of small traditional villages and large holiday resorts. Thanks to the mineral-rich spring water, there are also many spa hotels and standalone spas scattered across the island which specialise in balneotherapy.
Rhodes enjoys a typical Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild winters with a little bit of rainfall. Over the course of a year, the temperature typically varies between 10C and 30C, rarely dropping below 7C or rising above 33C.

Destination.create(title: "Tenerife", content: "Tenerife is one of Spain's  Canary Islands that sit far south of the mainland, close to the west coast of Northern Africa. The islands are known as 'The Islands of Eternal Spring' for their famously pleasant weather all year round.
A holiday in Tenerife can almost guarantee the perfect level of heat, little rain and plenty of sun. However, this does not apply to the whole of the island. The island is mountainous, sits in the cooling Canary Current of the North Atlantic Ocean, in the path of the northeast trade winds, and is very close to the west coast of Africa; these factors give rise to an exceptional level of regional climatic variation - so much so that you can generally choose what type of weather you would like to experience on any day. Transport links across the island are efficient and easy to find so wherever you stay you can always access a real contrast. For instance, you might visit in winter and hike up to the snow line on Mount Teide, then spend the next day sunbathing on the south coast.
This guide has split Tenerife into three areas; the south coast, the north coast and the central mountains. Scroll down to learn more about the weather specific to the area you are interested in.", price: 1300)

Destination.create(title: "Maldives", content: "Located just to the southwest of Sri Lanka and India, the Maldives is an island nation that forms one of the most iconic locations to be found anywhere in the Indian Ocean. An extremely popular holiday destination, the Maldives is a tropical and perennially hot resort, and its climate displays very little change despite the fact that there are two distinct and well defined seasons.As the northeast monsoon presides over a wet season that lasts from May to October, it provides a noticeable contrast of the period between November and April, when the sun shines for hours each day and the dry season draws holiday makers from across the globe.
Just as the average temperature in the Maldives tends not to fluctuate during the calendar year, the weather and climate remains stable across the entire region. While there is a little more rainfall in the south during the wet season, the temperature often peaks at an average of 30 degrees Celsius, with cooler periods registering an average 25 degrees Celsius throughout the year.
Despite this stability of temperature, however, climate change is providing a threat to the Maldives as a holiday destination and the island nation remains at significant risk of flooding in the event of increased carbon emissions and global warming.", price: 3200)


Destination.create(title: "Costa Rica", content: "Costa Rica has an exceptionally diverse climate for its small size due to the combined effects of weather systems originating over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and the Carribean Sea, and the country's mountainous topography. Costa Rica is in Central America and sits just below the equator between Nicaragua, to its north, and Panama, to its south. It is well within the tropics, but the many controlling factors mean there is a great deal of seasonal and regional variation in the weather experienced year round.
Costa Rica is part of the Pacific Rim of Fire, a chain of volcanoes, some of which are still active. Costa Rica has a high level of geological activity with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. While low - lying areas are hot year round, temperatures decrease at increasing altitudes and can fall to 0C at the highest elevations, though snow does not form. Most regions have distinct wet and dry seasons though in some places even the dry season sees abundant rainfall. In general, the wet season, also called the 'green' season, lasts from May till November and the dry season from December till April. The Carribean coast tends to be more consistently wet than the Pacific coast, and rainfall is generally higher at higher elevations. You should always check travel routes before planning your journey in Costa Rica as heavy rains often make many roads impassable.", price: 2300)

Destination.create(title: "Cuba", content: "Cuba is an island nation lying in the Carribbean Sea. Like its neighbours, Cuba has a tropical climate that is split into two seasons, one wet and one dry. However, year round it is generally hot with regular rainfall and high humidity, but also with plenty of sunshine. Cuba is part of the West Indies, the island chain that curls up
 from the north coast of Venezuela, past the southern tip of Florida and towards Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Cuba's position in the Caribbean between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, northwest of the Windward Passage, means its climate and day-to-day weather conditions are greatly moderated by the local trade winds. It also means that Cuba is in the path of Atlantic hurricanes. The Republic of Cuba consists of the main island of Cuba and four smaller groups of islands: the Colorados, the Sabana-Camaguey, the Jardines de la Reina and the Canarreos. ", price: 2200)

Destination.create(title: "Dominican Republic", content: "The Dominican Republic's natural beauty, great beaches and fantastic weather have seen it become a popular tourist destination and there are now many hotels and resorts across the country to cater for the booming tourism industry. In general the climate is tropical with hot temperatures year round and two distinct seasons: one wet and one dry.  Temperatures vary very little across the year but the early wet season is generally the hottest time, while the early dry season is the coolest. In the capital, Santo Domingo, for example, averages vary from 25C in January to 28C in July. Santo Domingo lies on the south coast and its conditions are typical of the whole south coast.
The islands are a mountainous home to the four highest peaks in the West Indies the tallest of which is Pico Duarte at 3098m. The country also features lakes, plains and plenty of coastline and this varied geography leads to a varied climate. The mountains especially cause a difference in rainfall across the country, with the north and east seeing a lot more precipitation. This is due to the northeast direction of the prevailing winds. In the mountainous regions it is always a little cooler and averages generally range from the low to the mid 20s. At the very highest elevations it can, however, get cold and sometimes drop below freezing.
The Dominican Republic has some of the clearest waters in the West Indies. This is one of the country's major tourist pulls. People come to enjoy the world-class scuba-diving and deep sea fishing. While scuba-diving conditions are not quite as good in the wet season, deep sea fishing continues year round. Many species of fish populate the waters year round, but some are seasonal inhabitants. For instance, both blue and white marlin can be found at any time of year but barracuda usually only visit in the wet season.
The Dominican Republic is a small Caribbean nation that takes up the eastern two thirds of the island of Hispaniola that lies in the centre of the Caribbean region. The rest of the island is taken up by Haiti. Hispaniola is the second largest Caribbean island after Cuba and the Dominican Republic is home to almost 10 million people.", price: 2400)





Destination.create(title: "Goa", content: "Goa is a fairly small state which lies on the coast of western India in the southern half of the country. The resort enjoys a tropical climate with hot and humid weather which varies very little throughout the year  the average highs range from 30C to 35C, whilst average lows range from 16C to 25C. Instead of the temperature classifying the seasons, it's the quantity of rainfall which distinguishes one season from the other.
Goa experiences two distinct seasons  the dry season, which falls between October and May, and the monsoon season, which falls between June and September. Almost all of the annual rainfall takes place during the wet season, when the resort experiences more than 2,600mm of rainfall. Precipitation is practically non-existent throughout the rest of the year. The rainfall greatly affects the relative humidity each month, which greatly affects the perception of heat from season to season.
The climate of Goa is influenced by the surrounding Arabian Sea and this causes variations between the coastal and inland areas. Goa is a large area, almost 4,000km^2. The climate described is that of the coast  where most visitors will spend their stay. Even just a short way inland, however, it can get noticeably hotter as there is no cooling sea breeze to relieve the heat. In the east there are sizeable mountains  the highest point in Goa is 1,167m  and these higher regions experience cooler temperatures and more rain than the coast.", price: 3500)

Destination.create(title: "Seychelles", content: "The Republic of Seychelles; located in a region of 115 islands amongst the Archipelago Nation is a small country with a tropical climate all-year round. Seychelles situated in the Indian Ocean approximately 1500km east of the African mainland is an ideal holiday for beach lovers and tourists who love to vacation in the sun.
Situated just south of the equator; Seychelles provides a topical climate, meaning daily forecasts rarely dropping below 26C and high humidity levels all year round. The region is hot and clammy for most of the year but the heat is usually moderated by cooler sea breezes flowing in between the islands.
Although the beaches on the islands are famous for the year-round satisfaction this region of Africa does not experience one distinct dry season. July recognised as the country's driest month, still receives 70mm of average rainfall. July is also the coolest month with an average temperature of 27C.", price: 2400)

Destination.create(title: "Cancun", content: "Cancun is one of the most popular holiday resorts in Mexico, attracting huge numbers of tourists from Europe and the USA each year. The resort is located on one of the most eastern points of the country within the Riviera Maya which runs along the Caribbean Sea. Cancun is vastly a purpose-built resort with much of the area being comprised of a thin band of white sandy beach lined by skyscraper-like hotels and lively bars, with a few ancient Mayan ruins found on the outskirts of the resort, too.
Cancun enjoys a tropical savanna climate with a very distinctive wet and dry season. Average temperatures vary very little throughout the year, typically ranging between 23C (73F) in the middle of winter and 28C (82F) in the middle of summer, rarely dropping below 21C (70F) or exceeding 34C (93F).
The most popular time to visit Cancun is during the dry season - November to April - when temperatures are slightly cooler and the relative amount of rainfall is low. Unfortunately, since this is the most popular time to visit, it's also the most expensive, so expect flight and accommodation prices to be sky high at this time of year.
The wet season - May to October - is slightly hotter and sees significantly more rainfall. Of the average 1,227mm of rainfall that Cancun gets each year, around 984mm of it falls during these months. Due to the less favourable weather, Cancun is less popular during this season, which means flights and accommodation packages can be snapped up for much lower rates than usual.", price: 1700)

Destination.create(title: "Agadir", content: "Agadir is unlike other Moroccan cities, a result of the 1960 earthquake which effectively destroyed the entirety of the city. It was the most destructive and deadliest earthquake in the history of Morocco measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale, killing one third of the Agadir's population and leaving 35,000 people homeless. Two days after the earthquake, which occurred on the evening of February 29th, the whole city was evacuated to prevent the spread of disease. The city was then completely rebuilt 3km south of its original location with contemporary architecture and a straightforward street grid which is easily navigable.
Some of the world's most famous architects were involved in this rebuild and as a result, Agadir is now a modern city of luxury hotels, golf courses and promenades. If you are in search of an authentic Moroccan town, Agadir is certainly not the place to visit. Agadir is now a white city, home to beautiful gardens, sculptural buildings, an ultramodern airport and golden beaches.
Agadir has a semi-arid steppe climate, with just two seasons  hot, dry summers and warm winters with just a small amount of rainfall. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies between 8C and 31C, rarely dropping below 4C or rising above 37C. These temperatures are much milder than that which you'll find in most of northern Africa.

Porto is situated in the northern part of Portugal, on the Douro River estuary, as it flows into the majestic Atlantic Ocean. With a chain of northern and eastern mountains bordering with Spain and hindering the airflow from Mediterranean regions, this northern part of Portugal is not as warm as the Algarve, or southern region, but it is equally charming and perfect for those who don't really enjoy the scorching summers typical to the parts towards the Straits of Gibraltar and north-African neighboring countries. Porto benefits from four gentle seasons, ranging from dry and comfortably hot to cool and humid with consistent precipitation.", price: 1400)

Destination.create(title: "Phuket", content: "Phuket is an island province located on Thailand's southern peninsula. It's Thailand's biggest island and sits off the east coast in the Andaman Sea. The island is lush and hilly; its highest peak is 529m. Phuket is situated around 250km south from the capital Bangkok.
Phuket has become justifiably famous as a world-class holiday destination thanks to its great climate and glorious beaches. Some would argue it has become a victim of its own success as more and more high-rise hotels have sprung up and visitors, once searching for ultimate relaxation are now often attracted by the seedier side of Thailand.
That said, there are still many charming places on the island and something for everyone from tranquil beaches to debaucherous night spots. There are also many other great places to visit in the nearby area including the stunning island of Koh Phi Phi and Krabi. Phuket vies with the famous island of Koh Samui on the east coast for the claim of Thailand's number one island destination.", price: 2000)
